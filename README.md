# Musics Effect on Mental Health
## Abstract
The objective of the dataset is to explore potential correlations between an individual's musical preferences and their self-reported mental well-being. Discovering these connections could enhance the thoughtful implementation of Music Therapy or offer intriguing insights into the human mind. My questions for this dataset would be "Can the genre of music we listen to impact our mental health?" and "Do genres such as hip-hop and classical music exert distinct effects?" The dataset contains information on age, streaming service preferences, prevalent mental health disorders, their perceived severity, and whether individuals believe music influences their mental well-being. I aim to establish a connection between the music genres people frequently listen to and their mental health state during music sessions. My goal is to identify genres that can alleviate the impact of mental illnesses and pinpoint which ones to avoid when mental health is compromised.
